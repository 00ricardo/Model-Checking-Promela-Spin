# Model-Checking-Promela-Spin
Model-Checking-Promela-Spin

This assignment consists of two model checking problems aiming to verify safety and liveness
properties using SPIN. Students shall learn how to model systems that have a challenging
level of complexity, how to specify correctness properties and how to apply model checking
in practice using SPIN. The assignment shall be carried out in groups of two students (groups
of three students are accepted in exceptional circumstances). The first problem focuses on
verifying a mutual exclusion protocol and the second problem consists in designing, modeling
and verifying a solution to the dining philosophers problem.
